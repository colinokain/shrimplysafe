## ShrimplySafe Information:
- ShrimplySafe is a tool that can be used to hold third-party encrypted, sensitive information as well as encrypted file transfers.
  - Every business needs a website. Not every business has the resources to invest in a large server for individual data storage. ShrimplySafe offers a solution to this by allowing third party businesses to register and save any information, only accessable by those who own the data, with one secure API call.
  - Businesses do not like hosting sensitive customer data. Hosting sensitive information can be a liability for certain businesses that are unable to invest in necessary security. ShrimplySafe seeks to alleviate this pressure by hosting the sensitive data for the third-party company.
## Technical Details
- ShrimplySafe is running on an Apache Tomcat server with a Java backend.
- MySQL is hosting the database.
- JQuery front-end framework for AJAX API calls
## Project Recap and Problems
- Although this solution is not perfect, our team came out accomplishing the goal we were hoping to achieve: to learn. Our team has gained a better understanding of text encryption, secure databases, and web-servers in general.
- The project is incomplete. Although we stated our intentions for the program, it has not implemented the majority of these features. The current state of the program is merely a preview of the idea of a safe storage for companies who need to store information but don't want to store it themselves.
